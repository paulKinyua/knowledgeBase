SETTING UP A VM ON AN ANDROID DEVICE:
Requirements:
- Android phone with at least 3GB RAM
- Install Termux from playstore

Step 1:
update pakages, run
pkg update

Step 2:
Install hypervisor by running:
pkg install qemu-system-x86-64-headless qemu-uils wget -y

Step 3:
Install OS (Alpine linux):
- start by making a directory:
	mkdir alpine
	cd alpine

- get the download link for alpine linux from their website (x86-64 virtual version)
	wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.19/releases/x86_64/alpine-virt-3.19.0-x86_64.iso

- create a virtual image that will be used to install the OS
	qemu-img create -f qcow2 alpine.qcow2 10G

- run the virtual image
	qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512 -netdev user, id=n1, hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=n1 -cdrom alpine-virt-3.18.0-x86_64.iso -nographic alpine.qcow2

- after running, you will be promoted to login, use root as the username

- once you login, create a udhcpc file and edit it
	mkdir -p /etc/udhcpc
	vi /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc.conf

- add the following line to the udhcpc.conf file
	RESOLV_CONF="no"

- work on the resolv.conf file next by adding the nameserver for the server
	vi /etc/resolv.conf

- add the following lines to the resolv.conf file
	nameserver 8.8.8.8
	nameserver  8.8.4.4

- once done, set up alpine 
	setup-alpine

- you will be prompted to enter a number of details to finish up the setup

- once successfully done, open a new session on termux and run the following command
	echo "qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512 -netdev user, id=n1, hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=n1 -cdrom alpine-virt-3.18.0-x86_64.iso -nographic alpine.qcow2" >> alpine.sh
- The command above will create an alpine.sh file that will be used to start the alpine vm.

- If you would like to start the server, go to the file that contains the alpine.sh file and run bash alpine.sh

SETTING UP DOCKER:
step 1:

step 2:
- run vi etc/apk/repositories
- update the file by ensuring the 2 lines are uncommented
	http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.18/main
	http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.18/community
- run apk update to update the new repositories added
